# Examples

The [source repository](https://github.com/engineerslifeforme/webslides-extension)
contains multiple slide deck examples that are split into
the categories below.

## Webslides Tutorial Conversions

Multiple of the Webslides Tutorial examples have been converted
to either their markdown or restructuredtext equivalent.  If
you see something in the tutorials that you would like to use
then the equivalent syntax is available.

```{note}
Not all Webslides tutorials have been converted
```

There is an attempt to match the source filenames (and 
consequently the render output filenames) to the webslides
deck titles, e.g. `keynote.html` tutorial is in `keynote.rst`.

```{warning}
Some of the tutorials were converted to markdown syntax.  It became
clear through this exercise that the myst markdown syntax is less
appealing for the directive heavy methods of this extension.  Using
myst markdown is still possible, but not recommended.
```

**Converted Webslides Tutorials**

- `keynote.rst`
- `classes.md`

## Extension Specific Examples

The rest of the slide decks are meant to demonstrate the webslides
builder extension and its unique syntax.  This includes some simpler
examples than the tutorials, which can be quite compex, and portions
of the syntax that are not present in the original html framework.
