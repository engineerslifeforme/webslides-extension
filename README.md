# Overview

A sphinx extesion to make slides with [Webslides](https://webslides.tv/#slide=1).

# Markdown vs RST

Both restructuredtext and markdown are supported.

`myst-parser` should actually be optional.  I may make it optional later.

# Running / Developing Locally

Make sure you add the webslides dependencies:

```
bash get_webslides.sh
```
