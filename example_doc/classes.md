Stendhal syndrome is a psychosomatic disorder that causes rapid heartbeat, dizziness, fainting, confusion and even hallucinations when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing art.

```
```{column}
{ph3}`.column 2`

The illness is named after the 19th-century French author Stendhal (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to Florence in his book Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio.

When he visited the Basilica of Santa Croce, where Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Michelangelo and Galileo Galilei are buried, he saw Giotto's frescoes for the first time and was overcome with emotion.

{ph3}`.column 1`

Beauty is a characteristic of an animal, idea, object, person or place that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction. Beauty is studied as part of aesthetics, culture, social psychology and sociology. 

An "ideal beauty" is an entity which is admired, or possesses features widely attributed to beauty in a particular culture, for perfection.
```
```{column}
{ph3}`.column 2`

The experience of "beauty" often involves an interpretation of some entity as being in balance and harmony with nature, which may lead to feelings of attraction and emotional well-being.

Information architecture is considered to have been founded by Richard Saul Wurman.
```
```{column}
{ph3}`.column 2`

Information architecture (IA) is the structural design of shared information environments; the art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets, online communities and software to support usability and findability; and an emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.
```
```{column}
{ph3}`.column 3`

The difficulty in establishing a common definition for "information architecture" arises partly from the term's existence in multiple fields.

**What is Stendhal Syndrome?**
```
```{text-intro}
Beauty overdose. `.text-pull-right`
```
Imagine that you are in Florence. If you suddenly start to feel that you literally cannot breathe, you may be experiencing Stendhal Syndrome.
{tpr}`Psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists.`

The syndrome is not only associated with viewing a beautiful place, but also good art. 

The beauty of Italian art has a concentrated perfection and transcendent sensuality that is incredibly addictive.
