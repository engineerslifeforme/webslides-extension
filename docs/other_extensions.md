# Other Extensions

One of the benefits of using Sphinx is the additional extensions
that are available.  Also, since the WebSlides extension outputs
in HTML like the default Sphinx behavior, many of the extensions
will work quite well since they are also targetted at HTML outputs.

Using other extensions typically requires individual installation
of the extension, adding it to the extension list, and any
additional recommend configuration within `conf.py`.
